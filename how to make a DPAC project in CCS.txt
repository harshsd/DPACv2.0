Right now we are using launchpad as on-board processor is not booting up
We will use the CCS software to program the launchpad.
Download the software from here : http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO


Download the c2000 zip file from here: http://www.ti.com/tool/download/c2000ware

See the user guide to add project to ccs and for making a target config file
The pdf file can be found here: C2000Ware_1_00_06_00\device_support\f2806x\docs

The project path is as follows: C2000Ware_1_00_06_00\device_support\f2806x\examples\c28\adc_soc

Add the file F2806x_Spi.c from the spi_loopback project
path for that file is C2000Ware_1_00_06_00\device_support\f2806x\common\source


now we need to replace the Example_2806xAdcSoc.c with the codes from dpac_codes according to the equation you want to solve

Now, build, debug and enjoy !!!
